# Architecture rules

- Fight-view dialogs reuse `useFightStats` and `FightTimelineChart` from the analysis overview so metrics and round charts share the same source and corner mapping.
- Editor statistics derive from the editable strike markers and remain visible without video playback, so saved analysis and subsequent corrections use the same data.
